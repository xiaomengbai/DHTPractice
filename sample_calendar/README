1. How to Build

   $ make

   All classes are generated under ${PATH_TO_CALENDAR}/src/

   $ make clean

   Clean all classes and data files


2. How to Launch

   The Server is CalendarServer.class and the Client is Client.class. Try:

   $ cd src
   $ rmiregistry 1098 &
   $ java CalendarServer

   Please try to launch servers on medusa nodes. Try:

   $ java Client ${username}

   to launch client.

3. How to Use

   After client launched, next prompt would show:

   ${username}>

   use 'create' to create your calendar
   
   ${username}> create
   Server Address> xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

   or use 'connect' to connect your calendar

   ${username}> connect
   Server Address> xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

   The server address is arbitary one of the servers.


   The following is some useful commands:

   'sched' schedule an Event
   'mod'   update an Event
   'del'   delete an Event
   'show'  show valid Events
   'sched10' schedule 10 Events around Jan 2010 [for test]
